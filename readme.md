# Introduction
This is a PyToch implementation of "Real-time Scene Text Detection with Differentiable Binarization". [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08947) 
Part of the code is inherited from [DB](https://github.com/MhLiao/DB).
# Purpose
The original projection is too heavy and not easy for us to use it. So this repo is to simplify it
## ToDo List
